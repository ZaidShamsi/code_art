# Spring Mass system
This project started with me wanting to explore waves in spring mass system like we observe pendulum waves.

Important reads:
- [The Simple Pendulum (Pennsylvania State University)](https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/Pendulum/Pendula.html) I found this page while surfing and its amazing. I ended up recreatig all of its animations.
- [Pendulum wave (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_wave)
- [Runge-Kutta methods (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)

# Equations
- Differential equation
  - $\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + \frac{k}{m}x = 0$
- Converting it into two first order equations
  - $\frac{dx}{dt}=v$
  - $\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{k}{m}x$
