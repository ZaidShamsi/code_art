# Drawings & Animations

Mathematical Art, something like fibonacci spiral, this is what is in my mind while creating this repository. This repo will contatin anything ranging from a plot of elemnetary mathematical equations to solving differential equations and finding out the beauty they create.

These drawings/animations are drawn in Python using turtle or Matplotlib.

### famous mathematical curves

Beauty! Its amazing to see that simple algebraic equations can generate beautiful curves. These curves can also be found in nature.

  - an intersting [anecdote](https://geoffjward.medium.com/a-tale-of-two-tombstones-strange-but-true-7ce6fab7fded): The famous mathematician, Jacob Bernoulli was so awestruck by logarithmic spiral that he wanted this to be engraved on his gravestone. The engraver did carve out, but it is an [archimedean spiral](famous_mathematical_curves/archimedean_spiral).
