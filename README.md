Hello!
- My intent has been to create and share scripts in this repository that will produce work products that are of interest to audience at large.
- At places, I have explored geometric patterns, physics' equations, solved differential equations. I have tried to include links to additional helpful readings in each sub-folders' README file.
- End goal has been to create exquisite work products. I hope it brings as much joy to you when you see them.

# Drawings & Animations
Python is used to produce visually appealing artistic products. Following libraries are extensively used
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Turtle

### Famous mathematical curves
Its amazing to see that simple algebraic equations generate beautiful curves. These curves can also be found in nature. There is an intersting [anecdote](https://geoffjward.medium.com/a-tale-of-two-tombstones-strange-but-true-7ce6fab7fded) regarding world famous logarithmic spiral. The famous mathematician, Jacob Bernoulli was so awestruck by [logarithmic spiral](famous_mathematical_curves/logarithmic_spiral) that he wanted this to be engraved on his gravestone. The engraver did carve out, but it is an [archimedean spiral](famous_mathematical_curves/archimedean_spiral).
